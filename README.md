This C++ program demonstrates how to display the binary representation of a float variable stored in memory. </br> 
It defines a print_bytes function that takes a pointer to a memory block and its size, then uses std::bitset to convert each byte of the memory into an 8-bit binary format. </br> 
The program creates a float variable height, assigns it a value, and prints its address, size, and value. </br> 
It then calls print_bytes to display the memory contents of the float variable in a detailed binary format, showing the raw bytes in the form of binary digits. </br> 
The program highlights how data is stored at the memory level and provides insight into how floating-point values are represented internally in a computer.
